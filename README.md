CS386X - Applied Neural Networks taken in AY24-2

### Taught by:
MAJ Sarah Smith

## Description:
Architecture of high-scale Internet services, using well-known case studies like Google Search, Netflix, and Uber.  System at these scales have many custom-built components, but they also contain many common building blocks that can be reused in other systems.  Students will apply lessons learned from case studies to build software systems in the cloud capable of scaling to millions of users, and they will do so with surprisingly little code.


The course will cover:
- Traditional 3-tiered software service design (frontend, backend, and database).
- High-scale software building blocks like:
• SQL and NoSQL databases
• distributed file systems
• message queues
 • caches
• content delivery networks
• load balancers
• serverless functions
- Software deployment and operations (DevOps) technologies and practices like:
• build and deployment automation (continuous integration)
• release staging
• virtual machines
• containers
• centralized logging
• performance monitoring
